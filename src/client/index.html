      <h2>What is net neutrality?</h2>
      <p>Net neutrality is the concept of a neutral Internet. Or any network, really. It is the principle that internet service providers, which you are connected to right now, must treat all data on the Internet the same. They cannot discriminate—or charge differently—by user, content, website, platform, application, device or communication method. A network for distributing public information, like the Internet, is at its most useful when all data is treated equally.</p>
      <h3>The Open Internet</h3>
      <p>A neutral internet is an ‘open internet’, under which the full resources of the internet and any means to use it are easily accessible to individuals, companies and other organizations.</p>

        Why does net neutrality matter?
      </h2>

      <p>There are very strong arguments in favor of net neutrality.</p>

      <h2>What is the impact on European internet users?</h2>
      <p>The impact on European internet users is potentially large. As a European internet user myself, I recorded internet traffic on my laptop for around half an hour. During that time, I was working on this article, looking for references on net neutrality, doing research on data visualisation methods, and looking at readme files for several software packages. In other words, I was using the internet. During that time, my computer sent over 70,000 packets to destinations around the world.</p>
