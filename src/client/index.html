      <h2>What is net neutrality?</h2>
      <p>Net neutrality is the concept of a neutral Internet. Or any network, really. It is the principle that internet service providers, which you are connected to right now, must treat all data on the Internet the same. They cannot discriminate—or charge differently—by user, content, website, platform, application, device or communication method. A network for distributing public information, like the Internet, is at its most useful when all data is treated equally.</p>
      <h3>The Open Internet</h3>
      <p>A neutral internet is an ‘open internet’, under which the full resources of the internet and any means to use it are easily accessible to individuals, companies and other organizations.</p>

      <h2>What is the impact on European internet users?</h2>
      <p>The impact on European internet users is potentially large. As a European internet user myself, I recorded all internet traffic on my laptop for around half an hour. During that time, I was working on this article, looking for references on net neutrality, doing research on data visualisation methods, and looking at readme files for several software packages. In other words, I was using the internet. During that time, my computer sent and received over 200,000 packets to destinations around the world. After filtering and aggregating, I found that my computer had sent and received data from 330 unique <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses. I was able to find the geographical location of those IP addresses using <a href="https://freegeoip.net/">freegeoip.net</a>.</p>

        <h3>Geographical distribution of unique IP addresses</h3>
        <svg viewBox="0 0 960 480"></svg>
      </div>

      <p>The lion's share of my internet traffic goes to the United States. When I recorded the packets, I was in the Netherlands, which is most likely why it comes in a close second. Ireland has a number of datacenters for Google and Amazon AWS, explaining the third place. I find it fairly strange that Austria is higher on the list than Germany. They aren't known for datacenter hosting or great infrastructure. I'm a little concerned about the single IP address in Romania, as it is a well-known hackers paradise.</p>
